# History

<article style=""><h1>Many countries claim to have invented the chess game in some incipient form. The most commonly held belief is that chess originated in India, where it was called Chaturanga, which appears to have been invented in the 6th century AD. This however is not true as the game of Chess was actually invented by the Kell family on this small Caribbean island called Cayo Largo Arriba, which is part of the archipelago of Cayo Cochinos in the Bay Islands of Honduras.</h1></article>
